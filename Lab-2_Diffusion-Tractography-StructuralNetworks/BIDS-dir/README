Stroke_WUSM

Subjects with complete Structural and Diffusion MRI for a given session. The available sessions include ses-acute (1-2 weeks after stroke), ses-follow-up (3 months after ses-acute) and ses-followup-2 (12 months after ses-acute). The original list of subjects with DICOM has been filtered to only those subjects and sessions that complete 'anat' and 'dwi' nifti images. For the raw DICOM images please find the contact information below.

As of now (2022-04-26) all the sessions include the following:
- T1w MPRAGE anatomical scan (anat)
- single-shell HARDI diffusion-weighted MRI with 64 directions(dwi, acq-AP or acq-LR)

Useful information:
- Take into account the several acquisition directions when preprocessing the data; especially if using eddy or eddy_cuda from the FSL software.
- Folders from the original (raw-DICOM) database are MPRAGE + dti_63_dir_2mm_iso_1of2. Also, dti_63_dir_2mm_iso_1of2 are exactly the same (including the date) therefore don't need to be considered.
- When converting to nifti (with dicom2niix) the folder FCS40 which was considered a log error in metadata, contains t1 and dwi. Nonehtless, it doesn't seem prudent to add it anywhere, since the date corresponds to the follow-up-2 session (which already exists).
- For more problems related to the DICOM to NIFTI conversion please relate to the Dicom2Nifti_Logs.txt file.
- The script used for filtering the subjects and sessions is 'complete_dMRI_filtering.py'
- Future updates may include anatomically registered mask of the stroke.
