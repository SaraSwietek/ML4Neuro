The course alternate 1 week Lectures/Laboratories and 1 week Projects

**Syllabus:**

**Lectures**
1. Introduction to neuroimaging data (date: )

2. Structural connectivity (date: )
   
3. Functional connectivity (date: )

7. BCI  & review (date: )


**Lab plans**

We alternate sessions of guided lab activities and assigned projects:
from October 3rd until January 23rd 2024 

1. Data structures, tools, and brain tumor segmentation
   
2. From tractography to connectoma (MRTRIX & DiPy), fiber clustering

3. Classify functional connectome via oldschool machine learning tools

4. Graph convolutional networks on functional connectome EEG

5. Effective connectivity with Granger Causality

6. LSD vs non-LSD group comparison, free assignment

**Projects** 
0. Proposed by the students

Crimi's project 

1. Natural scene reconstruction from EEG signals using generative latent diffusion
Inspired by fMRI paper (data and code available)
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42891-8
using the OpenBCI at our lab https://openbci.com/

2.  Structure-function coupling in stroke patients
Inspired by the healthy human connectome project (data and code available)
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920310946


Joan's project
3. Longitudinal evolution of resting-state effective connectivity in brain tumor or stroke

4. Super high resolution subcortical structural connectivity from and to the basal ganglia networks

5. Artificial neural networks and decision making in cognitive tasks

6. Some generative artificial intelligence with diffusion models and/or GANS for segmentation
