**Lab plans**

We alternate sessions of guided lab activities and assigned projects:
from October 3rd until January 23rd 2024 

1. Data structures, tools, and brain tumor segmentation
   
2. From tractography to connectoma (MRTRIX & DiPy), fiber clustering

3. Classify functional connectome via oldschool machine learning tools

4. Graph convolutional networks on functional connectome EEG

5. Effective connectivity with Granger Causality

6. LSD vs non-LSD group comparison, free assignment
