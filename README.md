# ML4Neuro

Welcome to the repository for the material of the course Introduction of Machine learning for Neuroimaging
The course is managed by Dr. A. Crimi, Dr. C. Koba, Dr. A. Onicas, and J. Falco-Roget

**Syllabus:**

**Lectures**
1. Introduction to neuroimaging data (date: )

2. Structural connectivity (date: )
   
3. Functional connectivity (date: )

4. EEG and wearables (date: )

5. Graph connectivity (date: )

6. Causality and effective connectivity (date: )

7. BCI  & review (date: )


**Lab plans**

We alternate sessions of guided lab activities and assigned projects:
from October 3rd until January 23rd 2024 

1. Data structures, tools, and brain tumor segmentation
   
2. From tractography to connectoma (MRTRIX & DiPy), fiber clustering

3. Classify functional connectome via oldschool machine learning tools

4. Graph convolutional networks on functional connectome EEG

5. Effective connectivity with Granger Causality

6. LSD vs non-LSD group comparison, free assignment

**Projects**
0. Proposed by the students

Crimi's project 

1. Natural scene reconstruction from EEG signals using generative latent diffusion
Inspired by fMRI paper (data and code available)
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42891-8
using the OpenBCI at our lab https://openbci.com/

2.  Structure-function coupling in stroke patients
Inspired by the healthy human connectome project (data and code available)
